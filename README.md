This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Thufir

Clone of Google search engine frontend made with Next.js

Made with: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Google API 

Enter a term or an URL into input search bar, press enter to initialize the search or press any of the two buttons bellow the search bar. 
The app will take you to the search results page, with listed search results. 
The search results consist of: direct link, page title and a snippet shortened to first two lines. 
Integrated pagination on the bottom of the search results page. 
Fully responsive.
Click on the "Thufir" logo to return to the landing page. 

Search results and number of daily searches are limited due to limitations of the free Google API key and a context key used in this app. 

Name "Thufir" stems from a fictional character Thufir Hawat, created by science fiction writter Frank Herbert in his book "Dune".
Thufir Hawat is a "Mentat", a specially trained advisor with seemingly computer-like computation abilities and almost limitless knowledge on myriad of topics and subjects. 


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
